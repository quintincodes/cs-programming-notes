## The `if` Statement

The `if` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

![[js/syntax/conditionals#If-Statement-Syntax]]

Here is an example of an `if` statement:

![[js/syntax/conditionals#Example]]

In this example, the condition `x > 5` is true, so the output will be:

```
x is greater than 5
```

> <b>IMPORTANT:</b>
> 📌 The condition in an if statement can evaluate anything—not just the block of code within it.
> 📌 JavaScript's strict equality operator (===) should be used almost all the time.
